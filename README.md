# RAG for Legal Document Retrieval

### Supervised by Prof. Ngo Van Linh

This project aims to develop a cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for Vietnamese legal document retrieval and question answering. The core objective is to bridge the gap between traditional information retrieval systems and modern natural language understanding by leveraging the RAG architecture, which combines dense retrieval techniques with generative models for more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project is composed of two main sources:
- Manually crawled legal texts from public government websites and legal portals.
- Private datasets provided by a partner company, which contain curated and labeled legal documents.
